Two versions of touch:

    TOU_ORIG.*      A very nice TOUCH by Christopher Laforet with the
                    non-unix orientation.

    TOUCH.*         Minor modifications by Reed Shilts to the above
                    for Berkeley UNIX syntax and OS/2 long filename
                    support.

    Both programs are DOS/OS2 family mode (bound) programs.
