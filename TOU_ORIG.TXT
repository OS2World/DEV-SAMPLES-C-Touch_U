TOUCH.C
=======

This program was created by me as a demonstration (albeit useful) for my C
students at Elon College.  The course is sponsered by the Burlington User's
Group, not by the college itself.

Anyway, I trust that the code presented would be of some help and should
demonstrate how simple it is to design useful utilities in C!  This project
probably took 45 minutes to write and debug.

I added a few features that are not found in most implementations of TOUCH.
The first of these is a verbose flag and the second of these is a confirmation
flag.  I believe that these should come in useful to many users at one time or
another.

You are free to modify this code at will, but I ask that if you add yours to
this for re-distribution that you would include the original with it.

Last, but not least, a disclaimer.  I am not responsible for the conduct of
this program.  In other words, use at your own risk, especially if you change
the source in some way!

In version 1.xx, I prepared the code for Turbo C 2.0.  This version has been
created under MSC 5.1 and is a bound application to work both under OS/2 and
DOS.

Under version 2.00, I added the feature of creating a file if one was specified
that did not exist.  This brings touch more into line with the UNIX utility of
the same name.
