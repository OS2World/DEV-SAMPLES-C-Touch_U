TOUCH.C

Christopher Laforet: Original version
Reed Shilts (v 3.0): match Berkeley unix syntax, added long filename support


Note from Christopher Laforet:

This program was created by me as a demonstration (albeit useful) for my C
students at Elon College.  The course is sponsered by the Burlington User's
Group, not by the college itself.

Anyway, I trust that the code presented would be of some help and should
demonstrate how simple it is to design useful utilities in C!  This project
probably took 45 minutes to write and debug.

I added a few features that are not found in most implementations of TOUCH.
The first of these is a verbose flag and the second of these is a confirmation
flag.  I believe that these should come in useful to many users at one time or
another.

You are free to modify this code at will, but I ask that if you add yours to
this for re-distribution that you would include the original with it.

Last, but not least, a disclaimer.  I am not responsible for the conduct of
this program.  In other words, use at your own risk, especially if you change
the source in some way!

In version 1.xx, I prepared the code for Turbo C 2.0.  This version has been
created under MSC 5.1 and is a bound application to work both under OS/2 and
DOS.


===========================================
Note from Reed Shilts:
    This is the best TOUCH I've seen in the DOS/OS2 world (accolades
    to Christopher Laforet), but the syntax didn't match UNIX and
    it lacked long filename support.
    Both changes were trivial and are quite apparent by viewing this
    and the original code.  The makefile was changed only because the
    executable must be marked to show it supports long filenames.
    
    Note: this doesn't handle touching files in other directorys!! 
        I wanted to copy some code out of the OS/2 ver 1.2 SDK
        sample program 'FDIR.C' which has a function similar
        to the DOS style '_splitpath' and '_makepath', but that 
        would be mixing copyrighted code with public domain code.
        You can mix the code for your own use, but I'm not putting
        that sort of hybrid on any BBS.

    This version (3.0) was tested with both OS/1 1.2 and DOS 3.31.
